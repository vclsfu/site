  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p id="about-p">
    Vietnamese Canadian League (VCL) is founded by Vietnamese-Canadian university students at 
    Simon Fraser University (SFU) to empower fellow peers to promote unity and to bridge the gap between 
    Vietnamese and Vietnamese Canadian traditions through leadership and community. We are dedicated to educating 
    the whole person and empowering student leaders for the future in a just and humane world.
  </p>
  <div id="about-box"> 
    <div id ="box">
      <h2><i class='bx bxs-pin'></i> Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We are a cultural, nonprofit organization dedicated to the general development of the student body. 
        Like other chapters worldwide, our purpose is to provide an environment for students with Vietnamese heritage
        and/or interest in Vietnam to maintain and promote Vietnamese culture and tradition, have fun,
        assist each other, make life-long friends, and build leadership skills throughout their university careers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id ="box">
      <h2><i class='bx bx-bulb'></i> Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We want to establish ourselves as a different entity from the current VSA on campus. 
        The VCL is driven by our fundamental principles that can be summed up in three pillars.
        Though we are an organization that focuses on the Vietnamese Canadian experience, 
        we are honored to be able to count many members of non-Vietnamese heritage as part of our family. 
        We welcome any and all students to come see what VCL has to offer!
      </p>

        <h1>Di Tim Tinh Yeu Culture Show</h1>
        Culture Show & Date Auction Fundraiser
    </div>
    <div id="project-right">
      VCL successfully hosted our first culture show, ‚Äúƒêi T√¨m T√¨nh Y√™u" which we translate to "The Journey to Love‚Äù. 
      This event was curated to be a hybrid of a date auction and a cultural celebration. 
      An event that celebrates Asian cultures and to unite our BIPOC student communities during these hard times. 
      Through this event, we hope to inspire others to find love within themselves, their loved ones, communities, and beyond. 
      We would love to thank Sandra Kwon (JeenieWeenie) for being our keynote speaker for the events, our kindhearted sponsors and sister VSAs for joining us. 
      With everyone‚Äôs help and kindness, we were able to raise over $1000.00 for the ACCT Foundation to further help the foundation support our Canadian Asian communities through these unprecedented times.

        <h1>Family Feud for Funds</h1>
        Central Vietnam Flood Fundraiser
    </div>
    <div id="project-right">
      Vietnamese Canada League (VCL) collaborated with over 10 Vietnamese Student Associations (VSA) across North America to raise funds for the flooding in Central Vietnam. 
      The flood had caused over 250 deaths, over 60 missing individuals and millions of casualties due to the flood and landslides. The flood not only impacted vulnerable civilians, 
      but it also damaged lands for agriculture and livestock farming. Through this collaborative fundraising event, VCL had raised over $1,400.00 and had over 10 teams registered to 
      participate in our Family Feud for Flood event. To further support the families affected by the flood, VCL has donated all proceeds raised in this event to the Blue Dragon Children's 
      Foundation and the Children of Vietnam Benevolent Foundation to help these organizations build flood-proof homes and provide emergency kits for the ones in need.
